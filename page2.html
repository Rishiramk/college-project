<h2>1.Snakes and Ladders</h2>
A worldwide classic board game! Navigate your piece from start to finish, avoid the snakes, and take shortcuts going up the ladders. The origins of this game are found in ancient India were it was known as ‘Moksha-Patamu.' A player moving up the board represented life's spiritual journey, complicated by virtues - the ladders, and vices - the snakes.

<h2>5.Winning the Game</h2>
The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game. To win the player will need to roll the exact number to get you to the last space. If the player rolls a higher number than needed to land exactly on 100, their piece does not move and remains there until their next turn, when they can roll again.

<p><strong>The Bounce Back Variation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game. To win the player will need to roll the exact number to get to the last space. If the roll is too high, the player's piece will bounce off the last space and move back. For example, if a player had four spaces to get to 100 and rolled a 6, the piece will move four spaces to 100, then “bounce back" two spaces to 98. <br> <br> <img alt="How to Play Snakes and Ladders - Bounce Back Variation" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0876/1176/files/i992_pimgpsh_fullsize_distr.png?v=1525141470" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; float: none;"></p>
